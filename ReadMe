Problem description:ACS End to End traffic automatic testing
Root cause analysis: To test the acs end to end traffic for first packet classification for every application have to type the individual dig command wrt each application domain and check response which is time consuming in testing process.
Resolution: To solve it I wrote a script which will take the all the domain name of all application present in app.json file and automatically perform the dig command wrt each application and store the response(app_id) in a log file based on date and time and if there is any diff in response then it will print in terminal.

1)domainlog→ This folder having date wise log file dig response of domain/hostname for all domain/hostname present in apps.json
2) IPlog→ This folder having date wise log file dig response of IP address for all IP present in apps.json.
